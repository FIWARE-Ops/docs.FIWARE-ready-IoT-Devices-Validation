## Guidelines for applicants

In order for any device to be considered _"FIWARE Ready"_ it must be able to communicate **directly** (using NGSI) or
**indirectly** (using an IoT Agent) with the FIWARE Context Broker. Evidence can be obtained by running a
[series of tests](#test-scenarios) which must be passed successfully to show that a device can send and receive
information. Also, for actuators it must be possible to send commands down to the device initialized by NGSI requests.

For communication between IoT devices and Smart Solutions, the FIWARE ecosystem contains two major software components:

-   [FIWARE Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion): It is the main access point for developers
    using the [NGSI](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) Interface. Developers can retrieve the
    current context of an IoT device as a series of attributes of an entity. Developers may also send commands to
    devices by updating command-related attributes, provided they have access rights for those operations.
-   [FIWARE IoT Agents](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/iot-agents). These components deal with
    southbound communications from the FIWARE Context Broker to IoT devices and also translate northbound communications
    from the device specific protocol into NGSI commands. This allows IoT integrators to connect devices, receive
    measurements and send commands.

Any IoT standard or proprietary protocol can be connected to FIWARE via the IoT Agent components. Currently FIWARE
provides IoT Agents for:

-   [IoT Agent for JSON](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-json) - a bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with a
    JSON payload) and NGSI
-   [IoT Agent for LWM2M](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lightweightm2m-iotagent) - a bridge between the
    [Lightweight M2M](https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/) protocol and NGSI
-   [IoT Agent for Ultralight](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-ul) - a bridge between HTTP/MQTT messaging (with
    an UltraLight2.0 payload) and NGSI
-   [IoT Agent for LoRaWAN](https://github.com/Atos-Research-and-Innovation/IoTagent-LoRaWAN) - a bridge between the
    [LoRaWAN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/) protocol and NGSI
-   [IoT Agent for OPC-UA](https://github.com/Engineering-Research-and-Development/iotagent-opcua) - a bridge between
    the [OPC Unified Architecture](http://www.opcua.us/) protocol and NGSI
-   [IoT Agent for Sigfox](https://github.com/telefonicaid/sigfox-iotagent) - a bridge between the
    [Sigfox](https://www.sigfox.com/en) protocol and NGSI

-   The [OpenMTC](https://github.com/OpenMTC/OpenMTC) Incubated Generic Enabler brings an open source implementation of
    the OneM2M standard. A northbound interface with the Orion Context Broker is implemented as part of the product.

There is also an [IoT Agent library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/) for developing your own IoT
Agent to cover any other possible IoT Standard not covered by the existing enablers.

New IoT Agents are being added over time, and the current supported set of protocols can be found within the
[FIWARE Catalogue](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/iot-agents)

<h3>Fill in the <i>"FIWARE-Ready"</i> IoT Device Manual Template</h3>

Fill the template named
[_"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT Device Manual Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_ic6Vy5g9i04Oe-kyFf8gxvP2862IVCGH9KJIqKuYk/edit).
This template requires you to describe how your hardware device communicates with FIWARE. If any sections within the
template do not make sense or not apply to your implementation, please explain the reason(s) in its corresponding place.
This document will be the basic one used by the user to configure and use your components, therefore, you should
describe in details how to connect the device to Orion Context Broker to send context information. If you have any
questions regarding the information in this template, you are welcome to contact the _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT Devices

Program, and your device will be published on the list of _"FIWARE-Ready"_ IoT Devices commercial devices available in
the **FIWARE Showcase** :`https://marketplace.fiware.org/pages/devices`. Once the product is validated you will also
be able to publish in your own web the program logo and specific instructions to connect your product to FIWARE
ecosystems (based on a template we will provide as well).

## Guideline for validators

In order to proceed with the validation of a FIWARE-Ready IoT device validators must follow these steps:

1. Check the information provided by the applicants. There must be at least a filled-in manual template.
2. Check that this template explains all the necessary steps to work with FIWARE generic enablers.
3. Check that the applicants have performed the required steps.
4. Check the logs, IoT Agent information and Orion Context Broker entries to confirm that those steps were performed.
5. If there is no evidence that the actions were simulated and overall process looks logical, that means that the
   validation has passed successfully. If not, ask to provide more details.

<h3>Possible infrastructure</h3>

Infrastructure should provide a possibility to check the connectivity with IoT Agents and message brokers. All endpoints
can be proxied by NGINX, since its log contains enough information about all TCP and HTTP connections. Sample
docker-compose file with a part of the required infrastructure, as well as instructions and variables for Postman
recipes prepared for applicants' guidelines are located at `https://github.com/fiware-ops/docs.marketplace-evaluation/tree/validators`.
