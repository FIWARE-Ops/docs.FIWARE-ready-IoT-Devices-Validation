<h1>How to apply</h1>

First of all it is recommended to do a self assessment in order to determine whether your solution is really _"Powered
by FIWARE"_ or not. So please read carefully the description provided as a [guideline for applicants](guideline.md).

> **Note**: Use of the context broker as an essential component holding the current context, and using changes in
> context to power changes of state within the solution is a minimal requirement for a _"Powered by FIWARE"_ Solution.
>
> If your application is:
>
> -   not a complete end-to-end solution,
> -   not using the FIWARE Context Broker
> -   your usage of the Context Broker is purely marginal
>
> It is likely that you will not be successful applying as a _"Powered by FIWARE"_ solution, so you should consider
> using another category when applying, for instance as a _"FIWARE-Ready"_ devices. If you are not sure, you can always
> ask for help so that FIWARE experts can give you some advice.

1. Go to `http://marketplace.fiware.org/apply`, fill out the registration form, apply by providing all your company
   information. Then, under the **solution/service** section, choose **"Powered by FIWARE" solution** under **category**
   and a proper domain of application.

2. Fill up the rest of fields providing as much information as possible so that evaluators can revise and, if suitable,
   grant your application smoothly. Particularly, it is important that you provide a document which describes what
   architecture and data models are in use by your solution, and what is the role played by the FIWARE Context Broker
   within such an architecture. The role of other NGSI compatible components (such as the elements of the FIWARE
   Catalogue) as well as other external components should be mentioned as well. Extra detail should be provided around
   the flow of context data within your system, and how the capture-process-actuate loop is performed.

3. Please provide details of the data models used within the solution, ideally in `spec.md` format and provide the JSON
   Schema. Examples can be found within the [FIWARE Data Models](https://github.com/FIWARE/dataModels). Where existing
   common data models are used, they can be referred to by name.

4. You may be asked to provide extra information or to have an interview with FIWARE Experts who might require extra
   information about your solution, so that they can make an informed decision.

5. In the event that your application is correct and satisfies all the requirements, congratulations you are now part of
   the FIWARE marketplace.
